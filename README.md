# Events Management System Analysis (Oracle SQL)

## Description
This project utilizes the Events database, which consists of 13 tables representing different aspects of the events management process. These tables include Events, Venues, EventVenues, Clients, Promoters, Sponsors, Event Sponsors, Tickets, HireCompany, EventEquipments, EventServices, ServiceCompany, and Equipments.

The Events Management System aims to streamline event planning, organization, and execution by providing a centralized platform for managing all event-related information. It enables event planners, organizers, and stakeholders to efficiently coordinate event logistics, track ticket sales, manage venue bookings, handle sponsorship agreements, and access essential services and equipment required for successful events.

This project uses Oracle SQL syntax and utilizes the Oracle Application Express (APEX) platform. APEX provides a web-based interface for database development and deployment, making it an ideal choice for running Oracle SQL queries, developing interactive reports, and building data-driven applications.
